  The purpose of the **Evapotranspiration** is to:

  - Quantify water consumption for all land use classes throughout the entire water
  basin
  - Describe the anthropogenic impact on ET and concepts of ET management to reduce
  total water consumption from withdrawals and inundations
  - Understand the impact of land use planning on consumptive use
  - Relate water consumption to intended processes (beneficial vs. non-beneficial ET).
