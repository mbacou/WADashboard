The purpose of the **Agricultural Services** accounting sheet is to:

- Assess agricultural yields for food, feed, timber and fish products 
- Compute the related water productivity (kg/mÂ³) and the gap to demonstrate loss of returns in
volume or value terms 
- Decide on future rainfed and irrigated cropping systems 
- Identify opportunities for saving water in agriculture.

Sheet 3 is used to assess agricultural production in terms of food,
feed, timber and fish products, to compute the related water productivity (kg/m3) and
the gap to demonstrate loss of returns (kg, $) and in showing which geographical areas
can become more efficient with water use. It can help in providing extra attention to
certain rainfed and irrigated cropping systems and indicates possibilities for saving
water in agriculture, with an emphasis on non- beneficial water consumption and shifts
from irrigated to rainfed crops and agroforestry systems. 

Sheet 3 is divided in two parts: 

1. Part 1 presents water consumption in agricultural areas, and 
2. Part 2, the land and water productivity.
