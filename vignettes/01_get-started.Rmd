# Overview

This repository contains server and client codes for a Water Accounting+ visualization dashboard. All codes and assets are provided as a standard R package. The dashboard application itself is written in R and uses the open-source [R/Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) framework.

The dashboard uses output from IWMI WA+ hydrological models, with the main code routine documented at [WAPORWA](https://github.com/wateraccounting/WAPORWA) (WaPOR-based Water Accounting).

Two hydrological basin are provided in the initial release, the **lower Niger River** in Mali and **Mara River** in Kenya. There are differences between the two use cases, in terms of data availability and temporal scope (e.g. in Mali only a subset of the entire WAPORWA model was obtained), meaning the level of details available through the dashboard will vary according to each river basin.



# Technical Guide

## Repository Structure

The repo is structured as a standard R package, in particular:

- `/data-raw`: configuration files
- `/inst`: client and server scripts and web assets for the Shiny application
- `/R`: all custom R functions
- `/docs`: rendered HTML documentation  

Inside RStudio IDE the application can be previewed in a browser with `source("app.R")`.

Shell scripts are provided to automate common tasks: 

- `/build.sh`: rebuild and install the package for testing
- `/pkgdown.sh`: rebuild HTML package documentation (uses [pkgdown](https://pkgdown.r-lib.org/) framework)
- `/deploy.sh`: commit release to Github, rebuild Docker image, and deploy image to AWS ECR  


## Configuration

1. Edit environment variable `WA_DATA` in file `./.Renviron` pointing to the root location of your WA+ model output (collection of CSV and NetCDF files). Any local or cloud-based storage type may be implemented (incl. Amazon S3).

2. Edit 2 configuration files:  
    - [List of river basins](https://github.com/mbacou/WADashboard/blob/main/data-raw/json/ISO3.json)
    - [Catalog of contextual geospatial layers](https://github.com/mbacou/WADashboard/blob/main/data-raw/json/LAYERS.json)  
    
3. Rebuild the R package and reinstall by executing `./build.sh`.


## Application Deployment

A Docker [image file](https://github.com/mbacou/WADashboard/Dockerfile) is provided for deployment to AWS ECS (Fargate). This image includes Shiny Server Community Edition and (for development only) RStudio Server Preview.

You can build and test this image locally with:

```sh
# replace {pwd} with a chosen password for the default rstudio user
docker build -t wadashboard .
docker run --name wadashboard PASSWORD={pwd} -p 80:3838 -p 8787:8787 wadashboard
```

Once you've established that this container runs locally, it can be deployed to AWS ECS (see [./deploy.sh](https://github.com/mbacou/WADashboard/deploy.sh) for an automated deployment script):

```sh
# Authenticate your local Docker client
aws ecr get-login-password --region {region} | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin {aws_account_id}.dkr.ecr.{region}.amazonaws.com
# Tag your image with your Amazon ECR registry
docker tag wadashboard {aws_account_id}.dkr.ecr.{region}.amazonaws.com/wadashboard
# Push the image to your AWS ECR registry
docker push {aws_account_id}.dkr.ecr.{region}.amazonaws.com/wadashboard
```

The dashboard application is served on the host at `http://localhost/WADashboard/`. RStudio IDE is reachable at `http://localhost:8787/` (replace `localhost` with your container's public IP or domain name).
