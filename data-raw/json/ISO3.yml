    The Upper Niger River basin covers six different river networks (Niger,
    Bagoe, Bani, Baoulé, Ninandan, and Tinkisso), and is transboundary between
    three countries (Guinea, Mali and Burkina Faso). There is a unimodal
    rainfall pattern with a wet season between June and end October. Forests,
    grasslands, shrubland, and cropland are predominant land uses. Large scale
    expansion of irrigated agriculture has occurred over the last few decades.

  description: >
    The Mara River basin has undergone significant land modification over recent
    decades due to the expansion of agriculture, deforestation, population growth
    and competing demands for different water uses. Water is available for further
    allocation during the wet season. However, during the dry season most of the
    available water is utilized.
